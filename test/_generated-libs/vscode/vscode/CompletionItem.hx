	A completion item represents a text snippet that is proposed to complete text that is being typed.
	
	It is sufficient to create a completion item from just a [label](#CompletionItem.label). In that
	case the completion item will replace the [word](#TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition)
	until the cursor with the given label or [insertText](#CompletionItem.insertText). Otherwise the
	given [edit](#CompletionItem.textEdit) is used.
	
	When selecting a completion item in the editor its defined or synthesized text edit will be applied
	to *all* cursors/selections whereas [additionalTextEdits](#CompletionItem.additionalTextEdits) will be
	applied as provided.
