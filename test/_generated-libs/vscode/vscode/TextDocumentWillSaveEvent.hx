		Allows to pause the event loop and to apply [pre-save-edits](#TextEdit).
		Edits of subsequent calls to this function will be applied in order. The
		edits will be *ignored* if concurrent modifications of the document happened.
		
		*Note:* This function can only be called during event dispatch and not
		in an asynchronous manner:
		
		```ts
		workspace.onWillSaveTextDocument(event => {
		     // async, will *throw* an error
		     setTimeout(() => event.waitUntil(promise));
		
		     // sync, OK
		     event.waitUntil(promise);
		})
		```
		
		Allows to pause the event loop until the provided thenable resolved.
		
		*Note:* This function can only be called during event dispatch.
