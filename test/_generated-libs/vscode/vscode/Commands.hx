/**
	Namespace for dealing with commands. In short, a command is a function with a
	unique identifier. The function is sometimes also called _command handler_.
	
	Commands can be added to the editor using the [registerCommand](#commands.registerCommand)
	and [registerTextEditorCommand](#commands.registerTextEditorCommand) functions. Commands
	can be executed [manually](#commands.executeCommand) or from a UI gesture. Those are:
	
	* palette - Use the `commands`-section in `package.json` to make a command show in
	the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).
	* keybinding - Use the `keybindings`-section in `package.json` to enable
	[keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts)
	for your extension.
	
	Commands from other extensions and from the editor itself are accessible to an extension. However,
	when invoking an editor command not all argument types are supported.
	
	This is a sample that registers a command handler and adds an entry for that command to the palette. First
	register a command handler with the identifier `extension.sayHello`.
	```javascript
	commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {
	     window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
	});
	```
	Second, bind the command identifier to a title under which it will show in the palette (`package.json`).
	```json
	{
	     "contributes": {
	         "commands": [{
	             "command": "extension.sayHello",
	             "title": "Hello World"
	         }]
	     }
	}
	```
