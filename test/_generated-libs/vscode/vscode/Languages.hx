/**
	Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
	like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
	
	Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	programming languages.
	
	The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	
	```javascript
	languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	     provideHover(document, position, token) {
	         return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	     }
	});
	```
	
	Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
	the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
	score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		Compute the match between a document [selector](#DocumentSelector) and a document. Values
		greater than zero mean the selector matches the document.
		
		A match is computed according to these rules:
		1. When [`DocumentSelector`](#DocumentSelector) is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
		2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
		3. A [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter) will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
		  1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
		  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesnâ€™t match, the result is `0`
		  3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
		  4. The result is the maximum value of each match
		
		Samples:
		```js
		// default document from disk (file-scheme)
		doc.uri; //'file:///my/file.js'
		doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
		match('javascript', doc); // 10;
		match({language: 'javascript'}, doc); // 10;
		match({language: 'javascript', scheme: 'file'}, doc); // 10;
		match('*', doc); // 5
		match('fooLang', doc); // 0
		match(['fooLang', '*'], doc); // 5
		
		// virtual document, e.g. from git-index
		doc.uri; // 'git:/my/file.js'
		doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
		match('javascript', doc); // 10;
		match({language: 'javascript', scheme: 'git'}, doc); // 10;
		match('*', doc); // 5
