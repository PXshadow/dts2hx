	static function openExternal(target:Uri):global.Thenable<Bool>;
	/**
		Resolves a uri to form that is accessible externally. Currently only supports `https:`, `http:` and
		`vscode.env.uriScheme` uris.
		
		#### `http:` or `https:` scheme
		
		Resolves an *external* uri, such as a `http:` or `https:` link, from where the extension is running to a
		uri to the same resource on the client machine.
		
		This is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine.
		
		If the extension is running remotely, this function automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel
		from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel. The lifetime of
		the port fowarding tunnel is managed by VS Code and the tunnel can be closed by the user.
		
		*Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
		
		#### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
		
		Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered [UriHandler](#UriHandler)
		to trigger.
		
		Extensions should not make any assumptions about the resulting uri and should not alter it in anyway.
		Rather, extensions can e.g. use this uri in an authentication flow, by adding the uri as callback query
		argument to the server to authenticate to.
		
		*Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
		will appear in the uri that is passed to the [UriHandler](#UriHandler).
		
		**Example** of an authentication flow:
		```typescript
		vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
		   handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {
		     if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {
		       console.log(uri.toString());
		     }
		   }
		});
		
		const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(`${vscode.env.uriScheme}://my.extension/did-authenticate`));
		await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
		```
		
		*Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
		a system or user action — for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
		`asExternalUri`.
